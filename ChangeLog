Version 0.6 is the first LibVMI release, but it is based on XenAccess.  The
last version of XenAccess was 0.5.  LibVMI can be viewed as a continuation
of the XenAccess work, but the name change reflects the broader goals of the
LibVMI Library (i.e., no longer only working with Xen).

New to version 0.6
* Improved source code organization
* Hypervisor-specific code abstracted out into 'driver' directory
* Support for Xen, KVM, and physical memory dumpped to a file
* Large API changes for improved consistency and usability
* License change
* Support for Xen 4.1
* Various bug fixes

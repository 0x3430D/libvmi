pyvmi -- A Python adapter for LibVMI by Bryan D. Payne

If you'd rather perform introspection using python, instead of C, then this
adapter will help get you going.  Follow the steps below to use it.

1) Build and install LibVMI
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    make install
    ldconfig

2) Build and install pyvmi
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

3) Start having fun with Python
    import pyvmi
    vmi = pyvmi.pyvmi_instance("win7")  # win7 is the vm name
    vmi.read_pa(paddr, length)
    vmi.read_va(vaddr, pid, length)
    vmi.read_ksym(sym, length)
    vmi.get_cr3()
    vmi.get_memsize()

Once you have pyvmi installed, you can write your own programs using Python or
you can use Volatility to perform your memory analysis.  To use Volatility,
you need to apply pyvmi_volatility.patch to Volatility.  This patch is included
in the pyvmi directory in the LibVMI distribution.

More information on Volatility and a link to download the tool, are available
on the following web page:
